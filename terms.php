By accessing or interacting with our servers, services, websites, or any associated content/postings (together, "PalletForest"), you agree to these Terms of Use (last updated November 6, 2022). You accept and agree that PalletForest is a private site that has the full ability to ban/suspend/revoke its users. If you are using PalletForest on behalf of a business, you agree to PalletForest that you have the power to agree to the Terms of Use on behalf of that business and that business agrees to the Terms of Use. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, you are not permitted to use PalletForest. We may modify the Terms of Use at any time at our sole discretion. You are responsible for periodically checking for modifications and are bound by them if you continue to use PalletForest.

The English version of the Terms of Use controls any translations.</p>
    <b>License</b>
    <p>If you agree to the Terms of Use and (1) are of sufficient age and capacity to use PalletForest and be bound by the Terms of Use, or (2) use PalletForest on behalf of a business, thereby binding that business to the Terms of Use, we grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-assignable license to use PalletForest in compliance with the Terms of Use; unlicensed use is unauthorized.

    <b>Use</b>
    <p>Unless licensed by us in a separate written or electronic agreement, you agree not to upload software in any way to our servers, including our messaging client. You agree not to copy/collect content via scripts, scrapers, crawlers, or any automated or manual equivalent (e.g., by hand).

You agree (1) not to bypass said moderation, (2) we are not liable for moderating or not moderating, and (3) nothing we say or do waives our right to moderate, or not. Unless licensed by us in a separate written or electronic agreement, you agree not to (i) rent, lease, sell, publish, distribute, license, sublicense, assign, transfer, or otherwise make available PalletForest, (ii) copy, adapt, create derivative works of, decompile, reverse engineer, translate, localize, port or modify any website/server code, or any software used to provide PalletForest, or (iii) combine or integrate PalletForest with any software, technology, services, or materials not authorized by us.
